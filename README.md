# ezg18-HauntedCastle
We encounter us in a medieval dark room that seems to be haunted. Only light falls inside throw a small window and we can barely identify the objects around us. Suddenly torches catch fire as if by ghost hand. We take a look around the room and see different things moving: A chair that is moving forward, chess figure starting moving, torches move to an upright position and paintings falling down.


## Scene
Medieval room with torches on fire, knight armors, chairs with chess desk, stone walls, paintings and closet.

## Effects
* Shadow Mapping with PCF (all objects in scene)
* Fire with Particle Effect (applied on torch)
* Glow + Light Rays (Window)
* Bump Mapping (Stone Wall)
